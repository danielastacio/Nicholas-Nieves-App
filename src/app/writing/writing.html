      	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Muscles atrophy, inspiration wains, and art can only get better or worse. I'll look back with hope, but mostly with criticism on this post, the lack preceding, and, cynically saying, the lack thereafter. I write for me, and for you. When most people speak in absolutes it only dismays their point. A strong vocabulary is nothing without syntax. A lovely turn of phrase is nothing without substance. And I am nothing unless I write.

			December 24th, 2012. It was snowing. I remember because it was that special kind where the snow doesn’t fall. Each flake specifically chooses its spot on the ground where it can perfectly catch the bouncing sun and reflect it back at you. You, wearing that frayed green sweater, sat on that bench holding back each tear. Each tear formed, but never dropped, every time I said I loved you. Here I was, in your favorite park, during your favorite season, trying to start the rest of our lives, and all you could do was cry. I began to pace. My purple flowers were dying while they rested on the snow on the edge of the bench. When I rounded out the fifth reason we needed to be together you finally stood. You still couldn’t look at me, but at least you spoke.

			Dave, just stop. You know this isn’t what I want. I told you, since the beginning, this isn’t what I want.”<br/>

			Not everyone has a story to tell. Not everyone is exciting or special or overly interesting. Some people are just there and live their lives and then go on just like the ones before them. But, some people do not. Some people elate themselves with self-important. Some people sacrifice themselves for something only they can understand. Some tend to dictate how the world shapes around them. And some sneak passed, with only one story to tell.

			In the heat of that summer night, Alison could have said anything out on that hill and I still would have been paying full attention. The heat placed my thoughts elsewhere. To the past, to the now, but mostly to the future. The future she wanted no part of. The future I did not know.

			He sat there. Just sat there waiting. Waiting for the lights in the house to turn off. Waiting for her to come out, suitcase in hand. He waited a long time. He even continued to wait as the sirens began to be heard over the hill. He continued to wait as car upon car screeched in position around him. He did not stop waiting when the guns were pointed.He did not budge when the yelling began. When the swat team arrived. When the guns were pointed. He did not stop waiting until Elizabeth came out of the house. When she came out all she did was point at James sitting in his car. She pointed and sobbed the words, "There he is."

			When James went home that day from his law office, he expected it to be the same. He expected to have lasagna because it was Tuesday, and he expected to watch the new episode of The Office. He expected to stay up late, wake up early and do it all again the next day but with meatloaf and Hell’s Kitchen. What he did not expect was a moving van to be parked in front of the house next door.
