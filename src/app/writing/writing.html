					Muscles atrophy, inspiration wains, and art can only get better or worse. I'll look back with hope, but mostly with criticism on this post, the lack preceding, and, cynically saying, the lack thereafter. I write for me, and for you. When most people speak in absolutes it only dismays their point. A strong vocabulary is nothing without syntax. A lovely turn of phrase is nothing without substance. And I am nothing unless I write.
				</p>
				<p>
					Pride aside, and vanity put away in the ugly brown box I keep under my sofa, I don't expect to be a writer. I do, however, expect to be heard. If I think on all the cliche lessons learned from prime time television, the life-and-death-meaning-scenario comes to mind first. (At least for the purpose of my argument) A man is dying. He doesn't want to be, but it can't be helped. The doom looms over the course of the episode. At the last moment, right before the shepherd takes him, he's given absolution. It's here that the tale turns. Sometimes he is given solace by his peers, or by his loved ones. Sometimes the mistake plaguing his soul is resolved. But every scenario has to do with remembrance. He can die happy if but one person will remember who he was. Often times it has to do with a bit more weight; that he not only is remembered, but touched their lives in a deep, meaningful way.
				</p>
				<p>
					If I didn't already make the commitment to, I would delete all of that
                    from a fear of posturing.
				</p>
				<p>
					 I'd say, giving it only the amount of thought necessary to go on, the artist is the worst victim of the fear of being forgotten. No matter what, our art is about leaving an impression. Some part of us stays with our audience through our selected vehicles. I write and act. Others paint and carve. Some move and wiggle. Defining art is stupid, and pretentious and a waste of time. I'll do it anyway. For me, art is our fear of being forgotten. 
				</p>
				<p>
					I will not be Hemingway. I will not be Neruda. I will not be Rowling or Tolkien or Martin.I will not change the face of change like Orwell. I will not make people fall in love like Bronte. I will not take away solitude like Plath. I will not make you believe in magic like Gaiman. I will not show you the green light like Fitzgerald. I will not give a voice to the voiceless like Wilson. I will not make your life better like whoever it was that you read that made your life better.....
				</p>
				<p>
					But, nonetheless, I write.

			December 24th, 2012. It was snowing. I remember because it was that special kind where the snow doesn’t fall. Each flake specifically chooses its spot on the ground where it can perfectly catch the bouncing sun and reflect it back at you. You, wearing that frayed green sweater, sat on that bench holding back each tear. Each tear formed, but never dropped, every time I said I loved you. Here I was, in your favorite park, during your favorite season, trying to start the rest of our lives, and all you could do was cry. I began to pace. My purple flowers were dying while they rested on the snow on the edge of the bench. When I rounded out the fifth reason we needed to be together you finally stood. You still couldn’t look at me, but at least you spoke.

					December 24th, 2012. It was snowing. I remember because it was that special kind where the snow doesn’t fall. Each flake specifically chooses its spot on the ground where it can perfectly catch the bouncing sun and reflect it back at you. You, wearing that frayed green sweater, sat on that bench holding back each tear. Each tear formed, but never dropped, every time I said I loved you.

				</p>
				<p>
					Dave,  just  stop.  You  know  this  isn’t  what  I  want.  I  told  you,  since  the beginning, this isn’t what I want.” 
				</p>
				<p>
					What do you want?”
				</p>
				<p>
					January 3rd, 2012. It was snowing. Inside Café Espace the air still smelled of Christmas and the people still smelled of New Year’s. I sat in the same corner I always do, trying intensely to finish a month’s worth of writing in an afternoon. Due tomorrow was a re-wording of state law, a botany report and a tutorial on internet poker. The description of freelance writing was probably written by a very good freelance writer. I picked this café all the time to be left alone, but some people go to cafés to be noticed. Whatever your intention, I noticed. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Through the awkward first dates and pretentious coffee snobs I saw your green sweater. Back turned, concentrated in the light of a laptop, your red curls bounced over top the thick green as your hands typed furiously away at what I could only have assumed was a masterpiece.
				</p>
				<p>
					April  22nd,  2012.  Every  night  was  spent  alone  so  you  can  change  the circumstances easier. You told me that after our first date. The creaking floor and cracked walls would spook most people, but you said they were that way to remind you why you were here. I still don’t know what you meant by that. 
				</p>
				<p>
					“I don’t have any plates, Dave, because they tie you down.” 
				</p>
				<p>
					"That’s fine, but how are we supposed to eat this cake?” 
				</p>
				<p>
					"I don’t know. But I know I can up and leave in the middle of eating it and nothing is going to hold me back.” 
				</p>
				<p>
					If I collected all of your sarcasm in a ziplock bag, the bag would turn into a piece of tupperware just to spite me. But I can’t pretend like I didn’t love this. As I sat next to your bed, eating cake out of a box with a plastic fork, you didn’t talk. You just watched me. Being loved is not the basic requirement everyone needs to be happy. It’s to be noticed. And here I was, doing nothing of merit, using no skills I spent six years of college sharpening, sacrificing nothing to prove a point, being watched. I think this is where I fell in love with you. In boxed cake, with cracked walls, and in a scent resembling purple flowers, I found someone I wouldn’t mind sharing my cake with. I fell asleep first. I woke up first, still on the floor but with you next to me, curled over my outstretched arm. You didn’t bring the blanket down with you. I held you tighter. I went back to sleep. 
				</p>
				<p>
					This time when I woke up you were gone. I would not have been sure you were there if it wasn’t for the lingering purple smell on my clothes. I cleaned up from the night before and let myself out of the apartment complex. It was cloudy outside. I wouldn’t see you again for a few months. Spring was here. 
				</p>
				<p>
					December, 24th, 2012. It’s still snowing. I’m still sitting on the bench. The silent sound of the stirring wind fills the empty seat beside me. I tighten my coat to stop the cold from getting in. It still gets in. It’s dark now and when I look up all I can see are stars. I count them. I feel small. You left behind your purple flowers. I reach out and grab some of the wet snow near me with my bare hand just to make sure you were actually there. That I actually tried. That you really did leave.
				</p>
				<p>
					As your footsteps fade to white I keep counting the stars. If you were still here I would make a joke about how your pale complexion would have made the snow jealous. You wouldn’t laugh out loud, because the vindication of a well told joke is something you never dared give me. There’s a lot you wouldn’t dare give me. The purple flowers look dead. After the joke you would have thrown some snow in my face, making sure the challenge of me and you was never forgotten. That no matter what, I could never hold a moment for more than a few seconds. That even in the cold, the snow would melt in my hands. Still counting. Still cold.
				</p>
				<p>
					January  3rd,  2012.  I  was  not  the  only  one  to  notice  you  in  the  café.  The brooders, the athletic types, the talkers, they all saw the green sweatered sprite captivating their café. Somehow you were loudest when you stopped typing and smiled to yourself. With a tote bag big enough to contain an entire life, you left with just as much zeal as you arrived. As if you were never there everyone seemed to get right back to their conversations and overpriced lattes. Some girl was complaining about how snobby girls get all the attention. A guy was explaining that with ten more minutes he would have took you home. Another was calling out his bullshit. 
				</p>
				<p>  
     				I tried to get back to explaining how internet poker was still an engaging activity without personal contact. I wrote a metaphor for the coming and going of wonder  from  our  lives.  Without  attention,  the  wonder  drifts  past,  not  leaving  a mark. But if noticed, wonder never leaves a space unfulfilled. I sent that article in without too much thought. Didn’t get paid for it. 
  				</p>
  				<p>
             		You had left the café, but you were still outside, waiting at the bus stop. Even if cold, you seemed content with waiting in the open-air. The fact is I am not the “going  for  it”  type.  I  don’t  talk  to  strangers.  I  assume  most  people  prefer  not knowing the people around them, but somehow I ended up out on that bus stop, even with my car parked behind the building. Somehow I wasn’t very cold.
             	</p> 
             	<p>       
             		June, 15th, 2012. As the sun inched farther behind I could see you inching closer to me. After months of only phone calls and funny texts I finally got you to see  me.  It  was  a  great  day  filled  with  fleeting  glances,  tension  filled  talks  and exchanged smiles. The city looked different with you. The usual places turned into funny colored alcoves of fresh familiarities. We end up on this bench because you tell me despite what you say, you need at least one constant in your life. You start to tell a story about your father, about afternoons spent talking without the angst of the world. You stop talking when you realize I’m holding you hand. I want to kiss you. I don’t.
             	</p>
             	<p>       
             		“How  about  it’s  not  months  before  I  see you  again.”  Your  smile  weakens.
             	</p> 
             	<p>
                   “Dave, don’t do that. Don’t ruin today. I don’t want to have a conversation that is going to leave one of us unsatisfied. Just...don’t...” As you pull your hand away from mine, my smile weakens. Stars are starting to fill the night sky. I count them in silence. 
                </p>
                <p>     
                    I don’t bring it up again. I almost wish I had. We end up at my apartment before nightfall. The first thing you say is a quip about how bleak it is. With just an old couch and stacks of papers and books everywhere I don’t argue. I offer you a drink. You take it. You also take a journal off the table. It’s titled Space.
                </p>
                <p>     
                    “Just a few poems I’m working on. Nothing too interesting.” I sit close.
              	</p>
              	<p>    
                    “Are  you  kidding?  I  think  you’re  secretly  a  romantic.  Maybe  you’ll  get published someday and I can borrow some money from you.” Your smile comes back.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “You probably write much better than me.” Our knees are touching.
                </p>
                <p>     
                    “Guess you’ll never know.” You don’t seem to mind my hand now on your thigh.
                </p> 
                <p> 
                	“Like  this  line  right  here.  ‘The  space  between  molecules  isn’t  empty,  but filled. More molecules of Space. More space filled molecules.’ I’m sure of it, you see love everywhere.” You drop the journal as my lips connect with yours. I drop my guard when yours connect back. We don’t leave the couch. All the space molecules 
					filling up the space between us disappear. It’s hot. The stars from the window are shining your face. I don’t count them.  
				</p>    
				<p>
 					December 24th, 2012. Today’s plan, the plan of a confessed love, a love that made too much sense to work, did not go according to plan. You sat back down silently after I asked you what you wanted. You just stared at your dying purple flowers. Maybe you would have answered me if I stayed silent. Maybe if I waited for you and was patient, you would have had a profound realization about how your expectations of life didn’t need to be so dark. The snow stopped abruptly.
 				</p>
 				<p>      
 					“If you don’t try, you can’t know. If you don’t hope, you can’t dream. If you can really look at me and not see an us, a possible future, a glimpse of any happiness, maybe you should just keep sitting there. As soon as you showed up things were different. You made me different. If it wasn’t for you I would never have gotten published. I let you in so far, but you can’t even let me read your writing. You put so much space between me and your feelings, how do you expect to find anything? If you really don’t know what the fuck you want, then just trust me enough that I know that this will work. We will work.” 
 				</p>
 				<p>     
 					“Dave! Stop. It’s not like I don’t love you....There’s someone else...”
				</p> 
				<p>     
 					 “What?” My sad face mixes with accents of anger.
 				</p>
 				<p>   
 					“I’ve known Adam for a really long time and he asked me to move out west with him. I think I might say yes.”
 				</p>
 				<p>      
 					“Who the fuck is Adam? Have you been seeing him? How come I’ve never heard you mention him before?”
 				</p>
 				<p>      
 					“I didn’t want to hurt you. You’re so fragile when things aren’t according to your plan.” The snow starts again. 
 				</p> 
 				<p>     
 					“This  whole  time.  The  whole  time  I’ve  known  you.  Has  this  been  just  a distraction from him?”
 				</p>  
 				<p>
 					“I  didn’t  expect  to  meet  you.  I  didn’t  expect  to  ever  feel  this  way  about anyone, but you showed up. And at the beginning you were both right here in front of me, I didn’t want to choose. I couldn’t. I can’t. But I owe him something. He took me out of a really dark place. I owe him.”
 				</p>
 				<p>    
 					“Owe him? You owe him as much as you owe me? What happened to not being tied down?”
 				</p>
 				<p>
 					“I’ve been hiding a long time from responsibility. There are things even you don’t know Dave.”
 				</p>
 				<p>       
 					“Then tell me.” 
 				</p>
 				<p>  
 					“I can’t.”
 				</p>
 				<p> 
 					“If you walk away from this, if you leave, you’re going to regret it. I don’t know when, but you’re going to wake up and something is going to remind you of me 
					and you will cry. You’ll be happy out there, but you’ll know you could have been happier here. You could have had something special. You could have been happier.” 
				</p>
				<p>  
    				“I  know.”  You  finally  look  at  me.  The  compassion  in  your  eyes  was  only beaten by the stiff upper lip you adopted. With frozen tears on your cheeks you reached for your flowers. You don’t pick them up. You turn your back to me and say one last thing.
    			</p>
    			<p>
    				“You’ll forget about me. They always do.” With cold water building in my eyes, it’s hard to watch you leave. I do anyways. A blurry green disappearing in white. I sit on the bench. 
    			</p>
    			<p>    
    				January  3rd,  2012.  We  sat  in  silence  as  more  and  more  buses  passed  by outside the café. The space between us seemed vast. I wish I was the first to speak.     
    			</p>
    			<p>
    			    “You only have one chance to impress a person. Stalking them at a bus stop might not be the best way to start.” You watch the snow fall.    
    			</p>
    			<p>
    			    “I think you’re confused, I’m just waiting for the bus.” I start to sweat a little under my heavy coat.
    			</p>
    			<p>
    			    “I’d believe you if the last bus of the night didn’t just pass by.” I was so busy building on an empty tank of confidence I wasn’t paying any attention to the buses.
    			</p>
    			<p>
    				“What’s your name creepy stalker guy?” 
    			</p>
    			<p>
    			    “Dave.”
    			</p> 
    			<p>  
    			    “I always sit out here at night. The way the buses pass through the snow, the people on a late night bus, it’s comforting. What are you doing out here Dave?” 
    			</p>  
    			<p>
    			    “What’s your name?” It blurts out of me quicker than it should. You don’t seem surprised.
    			</p>
    			<p>    
    			    “Why, so we can have a short-lived encounter? So we can fall in love and move to our Maine country house? So you can turn out to be a psycho and slice me six ways to Sunday?” I don’t have an answer. As you laugh at yourself a little, you almost seem proud of your ability to make me uneasy. 
    			</p>
    			<p>   
    			    “It’s Dawn. My name’s Dawn.”
    			</p>

					In the heat of that summer night, Alison could have said anything out on that hill  and  I  still  would  not  have  been  paying  full  attention.  The  heat  placed  my thoughts  elsewhere.  To  the  past,  to  the  now,  but  mostly  to  the  future.  The  future she wanted no part of. The future I did not know. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Are you even listening to me?” She always knew. Somehow, every time, she knew.
				</p>
				<p>
					It’s hot,” I said not really having much else to say.  
				</p>
				<p>
					“That’s not an answer, do you or do you not want to go?” It was always at the end  of  the  month,  the  night  before,  that  she  would  ask  if  I  wanted  to  go  to  her openings.  
				</p>
				<p>
					I don’t know. Do I have a reason to go?”  
				</p>
				<p>
					 “I’ll be there,” she teased, knowing full well I had no intention of going.  
				</p>
				<p>
					I see your paintings every day, why would I want to watch you kiss ass all night? You’ve gotten pretty good at selling yourself without me around. I’ll be here when you get back.” 
				</p>
				<p>
					She  stayed  silent  for  a  while  after  that.  Alison  does  not  get  angry  the  way most  people  do.  I  would  think  she’s  an  introvert  if  I  was  not  her  husband,  all reflection  no action.  But usually  the next day  when  I  see her  throwing  red  onto  a canvas, or covering bright colors in black, I feel safe assuming I’ve done something wrong.  The  worst  was  when  Meghan  Cooper  hit  on  me  at  a  benefit.  Some  trophy wife  who  had  one  too  many  Botox  injections  and  that  controlled whether  or  not Alison  could  show  her  art.  With  me  trying  to  be  semi  nice to  her  semi  boss,  Mrs. Cooper  got  the  wrong  idea  and  went  for  the  grab.  When  I  confessed  to  Alison  the next  day  about  the  cougar,  all  she  said  was,  “really,”  and  went  into  her  studio.  A silence  filled  week  later  I  was  staring  at  a  scene  of  a  fox eating  the  insides  of mountain  lion.  An  oil  painting  with  massively  hectic  brush  strokes  and  colors bordering on the tragic. For a week my nights were filled with visions of creatures excavating my insides. That was Alison’s highest selling painting.   
				</p>
				<p>
					Brian, why don’t you listen?” 
				</p>
				<p>
					“I  can’t  listen  when  you’re  not  talking.”  This  made  her  angry,  she  always hated it when I pointed out the obvious. Defense mechanisms aside, I hated it too.  
				</p>
				<p>
					No, not just me, to everything. Why can’t you listen to what’s going on right 
				</p>
				<p>
					now?” I had no idea what she was talking about... 
				</p>
				<p>  
     				I have no idea what you are talking about.”  
  				</p>
  				<p>
             		“I’m talking about the world Brian. And that you’re not playing a part. What 
             	</p> 
             	<p>       
             		do you care about Brian?”  
             	</p>
             	<p>       
             		I care about you.” 
             	</p> 
             	<p>
                   I’m not asking about me. I’m asking about you...” 
                </p>
                <p>     
                    The  question  would  be  easier  to  respond  to  if  I  knew  the  answer  myself.  I wasn’t trying to be distant or an asshole to Aly. I just didn’t know. She knew about the  medial  work  I  hated  that  kept  our  small  apartment  lit.  She  knew  about  how much I hated her cooking, but hated even more having to cook for myself. She knew that when she secluded herself in her studio for days, sometimes weeks at a time I felt alone. The last time, when she was trying to, “Invoke Picasso’s Blue Period,” I didn’t see her for fifteen days. She only left the studio when I wasn’t home or was sleeping. I didn’t even know how she was eating or sleeping. Throughout that time I heard  her  clanging  and  drawing  and  painting  and  mumbling  to  herself  as  she always did, but on the fifteenth day, nothing. No talking, no painting, no moving, no breathing. Nothing. I could not take it anymore. As I contemplated whether or not I should bother her, I heard a scream. Screeching and high, it was cut short only by me breaking down the door to her studio.  
                </p>
                <p>     
                    With her back towards me, there she was, sitting cross legged in the middle of the room. She was stark naked. Her usual perfectly messy black hair was sitting in  shambles  on  her  shoulders.  She  stood  straight  up  and  approached  the  window leaving behind one painting. Nothing else was in the room with her. Usually there would  be  scraps  of  mid  finished  paintings,  sketches  sprawled  on  the  ground  and paint covering everything including Alison. Now only a picture sat still on the floor. As  I  began  to  approach  Alison,  I  stopped  as  I  reached  the  canvas.  It  was  blank. Alison turned around and went to leave the room. As she passed by me, dumbstruck in  the  middle  of  the  room,  she  stopped.  Never  looking  at  me  she  said,  “Fuck Picasso.”She  continued  out  of  the  room,  ate  a  sandwich  and  slept  for  two  days straight.

                   “What paintings are you showing tomorrow?”  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Don’t change the subject.” 
                </p>
                <p>     
                    I’m  not,  I  genuinely  care.  I  don’t  really  get  that  last one  you  made  and  I  
                </p> 
                <p> 
                	wonder if someone else can explain it to me.”   
				</p>    
				<p>
 					“I explained it to you.” 
 				</p>
 				<p>      
 					I know, but it’s different. You’re my wife, I can’t trust your opinions.”  
 				</p>
 				<p>     
 					That’s not how it’s supposed to work you idiot.”  
				</p> 
				<p>     
 					“It’s not?” 
 				</p>
 				<p>   
 					For some reason whenever I show her the fallacies of marriage, she eases up. I’d  like  to  think  that  it’s  a  joke,  some  unspoken  truth  that  we  share  about  how ridiculous the conventions of marriage really are. About how we are so unalike that when  my  mother  disagreed with  our  dating,  we  got  married just  to  spite her.  But that’s not the truth. Alison would never admit it, but I know the truth of why she really  married  me.  It  wasn’t  because  it  was  ironic,  or  some whim  she  randomly obtained, or to get back at the naysayers. It was because she loved me. Five years we’ve been together now and only once have we talked about why we were married. I hold tight onto our wedding night. I can’t forget it. It’s all that I have left.  
 				</p>
 				<p>      
 					The  night  after  our  wedding,  in  a  hotel  room  of  some  fancy  resort  that  her parents  insisted  on  sending  us  to,  we  sat.  We  had  already  went  through  all  the stereotypical things newlyweds do on their wedding nights early on, and were now resting in front of the fire. She did not say a word the rest of the night, but she did begin  to  cry.  I  tried  asking what  was  wrong,  I  tried  comforting  her,  but  nothing  I said or did stopped her sobbing. She then pulled out her sketch book, a tiny leather bound  book  that  she  always  had  with  her.  Even  during  the wedding  she  had  it hidden away somewhere, never knowing when she would need to save a moment in time.As  she  leafed  through  the  pages  I  saw  some  of  her  drawings.  A  bird  with  a limping  wing.  Her  mother  smoking  in  a  chair.  Me  brushing  my  teeth.  A  flowing dress  that  looked  too  much  like  water  to  make  sense.  And  then  she  stopped  on  a drawing  that  was  spread  out  over  two  pages.  It  was  of  an  old  couple,  their  skin saggy and wrinkly, sitting on a porch holding hands. It was the two of us. When I started to once again rave on how good of an artist she was, she put her hand on my mouth  to  shut  me  up.  Then  she  pointed  to  the  date  in  the  corner of  the  book. 1/16/07. That was the night of our first date. Now, sitting here five years later with Aly, it’s all I can seem to think about.  
 				</p>
 				<p>      
 					“Jesus  Christ  Brian,  will  you  please  stop  your  shit,  I’m  trying  to  tell you
 				</p> 
 				<p>
 					something."
 				</p>
 				<p>
 					Aly, go ahead, I’m not stopping you. Just talk.”  
 				</p>
 				<p>    
 					“I think this might be my last art show. I can’t take it anymore. This life, me 
 				</p>
 				<p>
 					putting myself out there, you not supporting me anymore, I just can’t.”   
 				</p>
 				<p>       
 					“I support you.”   
 				</p>
 				<p>  
 					Yes,  yes,  you  do.  But  it’s  not  the  same.  I’m  not  the  same.  Something  has  
 				</p>
 				<p> 
 					changed and I don’t think I can do this anymore.”  
				</p>
				<p>  
    				“What are you talking about?”  
    			</p>
    			<p>
    				"I  want  out.  Everything  just  seems  so  dark  and  I  can’t seem  to  find  myself anymore. I can’t talk to you. I can’t paint. I can’t even seem to figure out what to do next. I just can’t.” 
    			</p>
    			<p>
    				“Are you asking me for a divorce?” 
    			</p>
    			<p>
    				Alison told me once that she would give anything to not lose her inspiration. She never would tell me specifics of where it came from, or how it starts, but she did say it was always there. She never could admit that she needed the art just as much at it needed her. It was her biggest problem. It’s why I love her. 
				</p>
				<p>
					We were both in the park. I was just passing through and decided to sit down and  enjoy  the  sun.  Alison  was  sitting  under  a  tree,  drawing  in  her  leather  bound book. I noticed her right away. She has always been really beautiful. Everyone who passed  by  her  would  stare,  myself  included.  The  difference today  was  she  would look back at me. From her drawing, to me, back to her drawing. I had to know what she was doing, so I went to talk to her.
				</p>
				<p>
					“Don’t do it,” Alison said as soon as I got close. 
				</p>
				<p>
					“Don’t do what?” I had no idea what she could mean. 
				</p>
				<p>
					“That  cheap  meet  and  greet  where  you  say  something  like  I  noticed  you alone, or you seem really interesting. You seem sweet and I want you to have a fair shot. So, how are you going to make your first impression?” She still had not looked up from her drawing. 
				</p>
				<p>
					I did not say anything else to her that day. I took her book and pencil from her and starting drawing a picture of my own. It was obvious she was a fantastic at drawing as soon as I saw her book, but that was okay. I drew two pictures one of a dog,  and  another  with  two  dogs.  Under  the  two  dogs  I  put  a  time  and  place  for  a date the next day. Then just walked away, not looking back. She showed up and we did  not  say  one  word  to  each  other.  We  ate  and  smiled  and  fell  in  love  without  a word. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Of  course  not,  but  I  do  need  to  be  alone  for  a  while.  I  need  you  out  of  the picture as long as it takes.” 
				</p>
				<p>
					“As long as what takes?” 
				</p>
				<p>
					“For me to find it...” 
				</p>
				<p>
					“This  isn’t  fair  Alison,  I’ve  always  had  to  deal  with  this  bullshit!  I  get  it, you’re an artist, but for fuck’s sake you’re kicking me out with no answers!” 
				</p>
				<p>
					“I know I’m being unfair. But you can’t be around for this next part. You just can’t.” 
				</p>
				<p>
					“You know what? Fine. I’ll leave, but don’t be surprised if I don’t come back.” 
				</p>
				<p>
					As I walked away from Alison I noticed she was crying. This was goodbye, I could feel it. I may never see her again and this would be how I remembered it, me being an idiot, and her crying the way only an artist can, while thinking about how they would use this later. As I got home I realized I had no idea how long to pack for. A few days? Weeks? Forever? 
				</p>
				<p>
					I was getting my suitcase when I found myself staring at a painting hidden in the closet. It was from before Alison and I were dating, when she was still in college. She  only  told  me  the  story  behind  it  only  once,  but  that  was enough.  While  in college  Alison  was  what  you  might  call  a  troubled  spirit.  Going  from  one  kind  of drug to the next, she was rebelling against rebelling and even she could not tell you why. Her boyfriend at the time, Carl, was even worse than she was. On a night that Alison could only describe as “moonstruck,” the two of them ended up doing acid in the woods. At the river was a waterfall that was a little too convenient not to jump into. However after jumping in, only one managed to swim back to the shore. 
				</p>
				<p>
					After  reeling  from  Carl’s  departure,  Alison  painted  this picture.  It  was  the two  of  them,  majestically  diving  off  of  a  giant  waterfall.  The  vibrant  colors  alone made the painting worth looking at, but it was Carl’s face that took center stage. A look  of  peace  and  tranquility  washed  over  an  angelic  look  made  Carl  seem superhuman  while  he  jumped.  But  then, after  getting  over the  pure  beauty  of  the piece  you  notice  Alison’s  face.  It’s  filled  with  desire  and  regret.  With  anguish  and thoughts of a time long expired. It was my favorite painting of hers. When I asked why she kept it in the closet she said because she didn’t need to look at it, she had painted  it.  When  I  suggested  selling  it  she  slapped  me  in  the  face  and  told  me  to “Fuck off.” 
				</p>
				<p>
					I did not hear from Alison until a month and half had passed. And all it had been was a text message saying, “I love you. Don’t come home.” I was beginning to wonder  if  this  was  it.  If  my  entire  life  would  be  spent  here,  waiting  for  Alison  to figure it out. She never was very forthcoming. Even as a child, she never could deal with honesty. Alison would never talk about her childhood, but her mother would. She  would  rave  about  how  talented  Alison  was  and  about  how sensitive  her daughter turned out to be. All  this with no help from her good for nothing father. Anytime  Alison’s  mother  would  bring  up  her  dad  Alison  would  shut  her  up  and storm from the room. Alison has no idea that I know why she gets so upset about her father. Her mom never did know when to shut up. 
				</p>
				<p>
					When Alison was seven years old, her mother was supposed to take her out to the circus one Saturday afternoon. A last minute temper tantrum from Alison made them change the plans to the zoo because only the zoo has tigers. At the tiger cage, to Alison’s surprise, was her father. However, before they could reach him, another family ran up to him. A mother and her two sons. Even though far away, they could hear  the  boys  calling  him  Daddy.  Alison  and  her  mother  did  try  and  go  to  him, thinking maybe this was all just a misunderstanding. But as they approached, he turned  around  and  began  talking  to  the  other  woman  and  the  boys,  completely ignoring  the  two  of  them.  The  boys  were  older  than  Alison  was. He  had  a  whole other family, and Alison’s mom was the other woman. Her father never came back home after that day. He made his choice that day in the zoo and they never heard from him again. 
				</p>
				<p>
					The next night she calls me. I don’t answer. She doesn’t stop trying for almost an hour. It’s not that I do not want to talk to her; the words seem to be lost at the moment. After a few more hours of pacing, booze, and fifteen rehearsed speeches I decide I should finally go home. When I pull up to the building my heart is off beat, not  sure  whether  to  quicken  with  anticipation  or  lessen  with the  familiarity  of home.  Inside  the  apartment  everything  is  everywhere.  There  are  dishes  in  the bathtub, magazines in the sink, and most of the furniture is gone. I know she’s in the studio before I even get close, where else would she be. 
				</p>
				<p>
					As I enter I first  take notice of how empty it is. It has not been this barren since Picasso. Alison was lying on the floor asleep, with a painting on each side of her.  On  one  side  was  The  Waterfall  in  all  its  vibrant  glory.  It  was  the  brightest thing in the room. On the other was a new painting. It was the opposite, bleak in color,  and  simple  in  design.  It  was  Alison,  alone  in  the middle  of  a  blackness  so engulfing that she was almost fading from the picture. In that painting I saw it, the loss, the hurt, the fear of not knowing. 
				</p>
				<p>
					I  finally  understood.  Alison  was  an  artist  and  she  had  stories  to  tell.  Not stories of bitter romance or times long passed. Stories that would touch people and make them understand the dreary state the world was in. She had so much to say, but I was stopping her. Here I stood looking over her best paintings, with nothing to say. I had no stories to tell. Except maybe one. 
				</p>
				<p>
					They found me in a hotel bathroom. I had stayed in the room for a week to build up the courage to do it. I passed while staring at the sketch of Alison and me, old  and  wrinkly  on  the  porch,  now  stained  red  from  the  blood  gushing  from  my wrists.  Long  after  I  am  gone  and  Alison  has  blossomed  as an  artist,  people  would ask her how she did it, where her inspiration came from. 
				</p>
				<p>
					“It was a gift from  my husband,” she would say. “He was always the better artist.”

					He sat there. Just sat there waiting. Waiting for the lights in the house to turn off. Waiting for her to come out, suitcase in hand. He waited a long time. He even continued to wait as the sirens began to be heard over the hill. He continued to wait as car upon car screeched in position around him. He did not stop waiting when the guns were pointed. He did not budge when the yelling began. When the swat team arrived. When the guns were pointed. He did not stop waiting until Elizabeth came out of the house.

				</p>
				<p>
					When James went home that day from his law office, he expected it to be the same. He expected to have lasagna because it was Tuesday, and he expected to watch the new episode of The Office. He expected to stay up late, wake up early and do it all again the next day but with meatloaf and Hell’s Kitchen. What he did not expect was a moving van to be parked in front of the house next door. He would have just left it alone, not bothered the new neighbors and went about his night, but they were blocking his driveway. After a contemplation of whether or not the ticket for parking in the street would be worth forgetting the hassle, James swallowed his pride and went to greet the new occupants. James, not enjoying confrontation, was fumbling with his keys and beginning to breathe faster. He stopped fumbling immediately after approaching the van. That’s because he saw her. Now while James was no stranger to the world of women, he could not help but be floored by this one. Looking for words to greet her was the furthest thing from his mind as he ravished at her long dark hair and her rosy complexion. Not even noticing James, she scurried into the house with some boxes. 
				</p>
				<p>
					"Can I help you?" 
				</p>
				<p>
					Not having the faintest idea of how long he had stood there next to the van, James was startled by the voice behind him. Turning around he noticed a tall man with a slender build standing there.
				</p>
				<p>
					"Hi, I'm Paul. Me and my wife are new to the neighborhood, it's nice to meet you..." 
				</p>
				<p>
					"James. My name's James Allen." 
				</p>
				<p>
					"My wife's name's Elizabeth, we're just arriving from..."
				</p>
				<p>
					And the rest of Paul's words just faded into the background because right at that moment Elizabeth came out of the house. Although he knew how rude he was being, James could not help but notice the ease that she walked. Basically gliding across the grass, Elizabeth did not notice the two men until new boxes were in hand. 
				</p>
				<p>
					"Honey, say hi to James." 
				</p>
				<p>
					"Oh! New Neighbors! I'm Elizabeth, and I could not be more thrilled about this place."  
				</p>
				<p>
					"Your van is..."
				</p>
				<p>
					"Oh god, did Paul block your driveway? I told him to let me drive, but he insisted. 
				</p>
				<p>
					I'll move it right away."
				</p>
				<p>
					And with that she was out of sight, moving the van. Paul started saying something else, but James was not listening. With a quick excuse me he was back in his car. He waited in his driveway trying to get one last glimpse of Elizabeth.
				</p>
				<p>  
     				Elizabeth limped in and sat beside the police detective, tissues in hand, both watching and waiting behind the double paned glass. When James entered the other room Elizabeth gasped loudly, dropping the box of tissues immediately.  
  				</p>
  				<p>
             		"Don't worry, he can't see you ma'am." 
             	</p> 
             	<p>       
             		"I know, I know. I just...I barely knew him, ya know? " 
             	</p>
             	<p>       
             		“Are you sure you didn’t notice anything off? Anything, strange about him? What
             	</p> 
             	<p>
                   was your relationship really like?”
                </p>
                <p>     
                   “I mean I said hi once or twice. Smiled, but if I had known...” 
                </p>
                <p>     
                   "Don't blame yourself. You couldn't have known, it's always the people we don't 
              	</p>
              	<p>    
                   expect. The quite ones. The nice ones." And with that the captain left the room. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Elizabeth just sat there in silence for a while, not saying or doing much of anything. On the other side of the glass, James did the same. When the detective walked into the bleak interrogation room, James’ composure did not change. When the detective sat down and stared straight at James, he did not move. 
                </p>
                <p>     
                    “Why’d you do it James?” 
                </p> 
                <p> 
                	“Ask Lizzy. She knows why.”  
				</p>    
				<p>
 					“That’s the thing James, I did ask her. And, well, she insists she barely knows you.”
 				</p>
 				<p>      
 					Only then did James lift his head. A chill gave itself to the captain when James looked at him. His face was so content, so peaceful that for a second the captain forgot about the blood covered gun he found in James’ house. He forgot about the mangled body stuffed inside James’ closet. Detective O’Garr forgot about Elizabeth behind the glass and asked James to tell him what had happened. James gave him a small smile and laughed softly. 
 				</p>
 				<p>     
 					“A man never kisses and tells detective.” 
				</p> 
				<p>     
 					Detective O’Garr still swears, somehow, he heard Elizabeth gasp through the glass. 
 				</p>
 				<p>   
 					It was raining on a Thursday. Trash day. James had known all too well Elizabeth would be taking out the trash midafternoon. He sat in his kitchen, looking out the window, with a full bag waiting for it. As soon as their front door began to open James sprinted to the outside, hoping to just catch her. He did. Not because he made it in time, but because Elizabeth was lying in agony on her front lawn. With a broken bag and garbage all around her, she moaned while clutching her ankle. 
 				</p>
 				<p>      
 					“Are you okay?” 
 				</p>
 				<p>      
 					“James! I slipped...Can you help me into my house?”
 				</p> 
 				<p>     
 					Of course James was going to help her up and get off that leg. However, when he got to her he could not help but pause. She was even more beautiful up close. Even in the rain with no makeup and garbage clinging to her clothes. Even riled in pain. 
 				</p>  
 				<p>
 					“What’s wrong James?” 
 				</p>
 				<p>    
 					“Oh, nothing...just assessing the damage. Let’s get you up.”
 				</p>
 				<p>
 					James carried Elizabeth inside. His heart was beating so fast he was sure she could feel it. Setting her down on the couch, James began to notice her living room. 
					Organized and precise, beige and bleak James could not help but realize this was not like Elizabeth. All these weeks watching her from afar, James saw her fun natured and vibrant. Her saw a woman who always took her time outside to breath. A woman who would be excited by the prospect of the sun, and rejoiced in the rain. With no color, James honestly thought maybe he had entered the wrong house.  
 				</p>
 				<p>       
 					James stayed for about an hour, helping to nurse Elizabeth’s ankle. When she seemed content enough, James began to get ready to leave, thinking he should not overstay his welcome. She urged him to stay and he did. James would in fact not leave until the next day.  
 				</p>
 				<p>  
 					They both did not sleep that night. 
 				</p>
 				<p> 
 					Detective O’Garr stood in that crime scene for a long time. James’ house, covered in caution tape and filled with police, felt off to the detective. He looked at the body again and saw the workings of a madman. He went to the kitchen, where he noticed boxes of frozen dinners and note upon note all written hastily and about the same topic. The most recent saying that today James would finally talk to her. Next to that note, three bottles of prescription pills, all different, all empty. All that made sense to Detective O’Garr, but what James last said was lingering. The other officers were wrapping up, thinking this case simple, easy. But O’Garr did not feel the same way. 
				</p>
				<p>  
    				He was now in James’ room looking through his things. Out of the corner of his eye, he noticed the dresser. It was scooted forward, away from the wall just enough so that he could see a shimmer behind it. O’Garr pushed the dresser to the side and saw the safe, half open. Inside was only one thing. Another note. But this one did not have James’ distinctive manic handwriting. It was written by a woman. And all it said was, “Tonight.” Along with Paul and James’ money, Elizabeth disappeared.
